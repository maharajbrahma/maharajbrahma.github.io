Hi! I’m Maharaj, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the Indian [Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH)](https://iith.ac.in/).  I'm fortunate to be supervised by Dr. [Maunendra Sankar Desarkar](https://people.iith.ac.in/maunendra/index.html). My research interests include natural language processing, building resources for low-resource language, and machine translation.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my Master of Technology (M.Tech.) at [Central Institute of Technology Kokrajhar (CITK)](https://cit.ac.in/), CFTI, Deemed to be University under MoE, India. I was fortunate to be supervised by (sir) Mr. [Sanjib Narzary](https://cit.ac.in/departments/profile/cse/sanjib-narzary), and I worked on Machine Translation for the under-resourced Indian language Bodo.  I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the master's course Advanced Computer Network Lab (PCSE271) and the undergraduate course Programming for Problem Solving Lab (UCSE271). I was a TA for the master’s course Mobile and Pervasive Computing (PCSE115), instructed by (sir) Dr. [Pranav Kumar Singh](https://cit.ac.in/departments/profile/cse/pranav-kumar-singh).

In 2020, I had the good fortune to co-found a startup ["DigitalOma"](https://digitaloma.com) along with my friends.

I received my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Computer Science & Engineering from CIT Kokrajhar, India in 2019 and worked on a thesis titled *"English-Bodo Neural Machine Translation using Attention Mechanism"*.
