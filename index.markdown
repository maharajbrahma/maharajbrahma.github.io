Hi! I am Maharaj Brahma, a second year Master of Technology (M.Tech.) student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the Central Institute of Technology (CIT) Kokrajhar, Deemed to be University under MoE, India.

I'm currently supervised by sir [(Mr.) Sanjib Narzary](https://cit.ac.in/departments/profile/cse/sanjib-narzary) and I am working on Machine Translation for the under-resource language Indian language Bodo. 

Currently, I'm serving as a Teaching Assistant for the masters course Mobile and Pervasive Computing (PCSE115) instructed by sir [(Dr.) Pranav Kumar Singh](https://cit.ac.in/departments/profile/cse/pranav-kumar-singh).

In 2020, I had the good fortune to co-found a local startup ["DigitalOma"](https://digitaloma.com) along with my friends.

I received my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Computer Science & Engineering from CIT Kokrajhar, India in 2019 and worked on a thesis titled *"English-Bodo Neural Machine Translation using Attention Mechanism"*
