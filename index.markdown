Hi! I'm Maharaj, a third-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [Natural Language and Information Processing (NLIP) Lab](https://nlip-lab.github.io/nlip) in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH)](https://iith.ac.in/) supervised by [Prof. Maunendra Sankar Desarkar](https://people.iith.ac.in/maunendra/index.html) and [Dr. Anoop Kunchukuttan](http://anoopk.in/). My research interest focuses on **Culture NLP, Multilingual NLP, and Machine Translation**. I am also interested in building resources for low-resource languages.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my Master of Technology (M.Tech.) at [Central Institute of Technology Kokrajhar (CITK)](https://cit.ac.in/), CFTI, Deemed to be University under MoE, India. I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Sanjib Narzary](https://cit.ac.in/profile-cse-sanjib-narzary), and I worked on Machine Translation for the under-resourced Indian language Bodo.  I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the master's course Advanced Computer Network Lab (PCSE271) and the undergraduate course Programming for Problem Solving Lab (UCSE271). I was a TA for the master’s course Mobile and Pervasive Computing (PCSE115), instructed by [Prof. Pranav Kumar Singh](https://cit.ac.in/profile-cse-dr-pranav-kumar-singh).

In 2020, I had the good fortune to co-found a startup ["DigitalOma"](https://digitaloma.com) along with my friends.

I received my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Computer Science & Engineering from CIT Kokrajhar, India in 2019 and worked on a thesis titled *"English-Bodo Neural Machine Translation using Attention Mechanism"*.
