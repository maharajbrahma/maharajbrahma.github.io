Long felt nature and its outset.

The playfulness, the youngness of the Mud.

Long felt the Mud.

Oh Mud, long did I feel you.

Once played with you. Once stepped inside you. Once covered my face with you.

Oh Mud, even then, you felt like bliss.

Your brown scent syncs with nature, like a cream of Mother Earth.

Down the memory lane in search of you.

I go to the plane of playfulness in those paddy fields.

Oh Mud, long did I feel you.

Oh Mud, remembering how happy I was to play with you when I went to catch fish.

Oh Mud, remembering the touch of your skin with mine.

Oh Mud, even your dryness in my skin is like a portion of torn soil.

Long did I bathe with you.

Oh Mud, long did I feel you.
